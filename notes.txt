The manifest.json file is the starting point for creating an extension. 
It specifies the extension's platform version and other default loading information. 
Every extension, regardless of the browser (e.g., Safari, Mozilla, or Chromium-based), 
requires a manifest.json file.

The manifest.json file is crucial for the extension and must be present for it to work. 
It contains important details such as the extension's name, version number, and description. 
The version number is displayed when the extension is loaded, and the name is the name 
of the extension when loaded.

Permissions are another important aspect of the manifest.json file. Different Chrome 
extensions may require different permissions. In this particular extension, two 
permissions are requested: chrome.storage API for storing data in the user's browser 
and chrome.tabs API for accessing the browser's tab system. The chrome.tabs API helps 
identify the current browser tab and retrieve the URL, specifically for YouTube video 
pages in this extension.

Host permissions allow sending cross-origin requests to specific host names. In this 
extension, the host pattern is set to match YouTube pages since it only deals with YouTube.

Service workers are significant changes between extension versions (v2 and v3). They 
are JavaScript files running separately from the main browser thread. Although they 
don't have direct access to webpage content, service workers can communicate with 
the extension using the extension's messaging system, which will be used in the 
bookmarking extension.

Content scripts are files that run in the context of the webpages the extension 
is active on. They are used to manipulate the DOM of the webpage. The content script 
file is specified as content_script.js.

The manifest.json file also references the default popup UI file, popup.html. In 
this case, the associated interactivity file is popup.js.
